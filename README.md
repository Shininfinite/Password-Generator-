# Password-Generator-
Python script used to generate passwords

This code uses the string module to define a string of all possible characters that could be in a password, including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and punctuation marks.

The 'random.choice' function is used to randomly select characters from this string to build the password.

The 'generate_password' function takes a single argument 'length' which specifies the desired length of the password to be generated.

Feel free to adjust the length argument to generate a password of your desired length.
